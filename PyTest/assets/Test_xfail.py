#xfail is a marker used to indicate that a test is expected to fail due to a known issue (e.g., a bug or an unimplemented feature)

import  pytest
@pytest.mark.xfail(reason="Known bug in the third-party library")
def test_function_with_bug():
    assert (1 + 1) == 3 # This is assertion will fail as expected

# testcase 1
@pytest.mark.sanity
def testcase1():
    print("Testcase1 is executed")

# testcase 2
@pytest.mark.regression
def testcase2():
    print("Testcase2 is executed")

# testcase 3
